Robot Royal Rumble
==========================================
As Arduino based devices take over the world, developers are summoned to create experiences that intrigue, surprise, and delight. There is a challenge, though, facing enterprising developers who want to enter this domain - what language to choose. Should you choose the seemingly default answer of C. You use Ruby or C# at your job, so maybe one of those will work? What about Node - that's popular now, and you keep hearing more noise about that upstart Go. This talk will pit these languages in a battle royal while crafting a program to control a friendly battle bot. As the languages clash, you will explore the ecosystem and the tools each brings to the ring. Join in the fray, cheer on your favorite, and see which comes out on top.

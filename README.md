Robot Royal Rumble
==========================================
As Arduino based devices take over the world, developers are summoned to create experiences that intrigue, surprise, and delight. There is a challenge, though, facing enterprising developers who want to enter this domain - what language to choose. Should you choose the seemingly default answer of C or maybe Ruby? What about Node - that's popular now, but you keep hearing more noise about the upstart Go. This talk will pit these languages in a battle royal while crafting a program to control a friendly battle bot. As the languages clash, you will explore the ecosystem and the tools each brings to the ring. Join in the fray, cheer on your favorite, and see which comes out on top.

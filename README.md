Robot Royal Rumble
==========================================
Devices are taking over the world and they are inviting developers to create experiences that intrigue, surprise, and delight. There is a challenge, though, facing enterprising developers who want to enter this domain - what language to choose? Should you choose the seemingly default answer of C or maybe Ruby, what about Node - that's popular now, and you keep hearing more noise about the upstart Go. This talk will pit these languages in a battle royale while crafting a program to control a friedly battle bot. As the languages clash, you will explore the echosystem and tools each brings to the ring. Join in the fray, cheer on your favorite, and see which comes out on top.
